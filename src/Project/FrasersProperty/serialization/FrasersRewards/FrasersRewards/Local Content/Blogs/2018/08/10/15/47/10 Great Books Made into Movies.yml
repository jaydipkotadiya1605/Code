        <p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&rdquo; from <em>Fragile Things</em> by Neil Gaiman</strong>Nominated for the Hugo Award in 2007 for Best Short Story, &ldquo;How to Talk to Girls at Parties&rdquo; is a sci-fi story set in the punk era of the 1970s. Teenagers Vic and Enn end up at a bizarre party, where they discover a beautiful group of women who turn out to be other-worldly creatures.

        <p><strong>3.&nbsp;<em>Frankenstein</em> by Mary Shelley</strong></p>
        <p>Would you believe that literature&rsquo;s most iconic monster was created by an 18-year-old girl?</p>
        <p>While we may be more familiar with the green-skinned creature and its maker Victor Frankenstein, what&rsquo;s more remarkable is the gutsy woman behind this famed figure of fear. In 1816, Shelley started this book out of a dare by fellow writer Lord Byron, and published it two years later when she was just 20. If you haven&rsquo;t read this gothic-horror, we guarantee you&rsquo;d be devouring this haunting and enduring work.</p>
        <p>Although <em>Frankenstein</em> is considered by some as the pioneering science-fiction novel, Shelley&rsquo;s personal life was full of drama and tragedy. Experience the author&rsquo;s trials in the film <em>Mary Shelley,</em> with Elle Fanning also as the leading lady. Here, she plays the unstoppable genius defying social conventions to produce one of the world&rsquo;s most terrifying tales.</p>
        <p><em>Frankenstein</em> available at Times Bookstores at <a href="http://www.frasersrewards.com/store-detail.php?CategoryID=594&amp;StoreID=4353">The Centrepoint</a> and <a href="http://www.frasersrewards.com/store-detail.php?CategoryID=594&amp;StoreID=8681">Waterway Point</a>.</p>

        <strong>6.&nbsp;<em>Series of Unfortunate Events</em> by Lemony Snicket</strong>This collection of 13 children books with a macabre twist is guaranteed to keep the kids engrossed for a long while. The books follow the lives of orphans­­,&nbsp;Violet,&nbsp;Klaus, and&nbsp;Sunny Baudelaire and their sinister custodian&nbsp;Count Olaf.

        <p><strong>7.&nbsp;<em>Life of Pi</em> by Yann Martel</strong></p>
        <p>Barack Obama read this novel with his daughter and was so taken by it that he personally wrote to the author in praise of the book. A story of spiritual and fantastic dimensions, this Man Booker Prize winning book tells of the voyage of Pi, with a tiger named Richard Parker after a shipwreck. Through the journey, Pi and Parker encounter many challenges and eventually develop a lasting bond. Its blockbuster movie adaptation garnered a slew of awards, including Best Original Screenplay at the Golden Globes and an Oscar for Ang Lee&rsquo;s directing.</p>

        <p><strong>8.&nbsp;<em>Gone Girl</em> by Gillian Flynn</strong>This is an absolute page-turner for those who like action that&rsquo;s dark and twisted. A husband becomes a suspect in his wife&rsquo;s disappearance and their contrasting narratives will keep you guessing on whose account is true. Throw in a few twists and turns along with gore, and this is the perfect thriller. Its film adaptation was also well-received, with Rosamund Pike&rsquo;s icy portrayal as the female lead landing her a Best Actress nomination at the 2015 Academy Awards.</p>

        <p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;<strong><em>The Lovely Bones</em> by Alice Sebold</strong></p>
        <p>Told from the perspective of a gruesomely murdered 14-year-old Susie Salmon, this story doesn&rsquo;t shy away from heavy themes while remaining a charmingly ethereal tale. As Susie watches from heaven, the lives of her family, a detective and her murderer unfold in complex ways. Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings fame directed the movie adaptation, lending his fantastical eye to the visually stunning film.</p>

        <p><strong><em>10. Fight Club</em> by Chuck Palahniuk</strong></p>
        <p>A movie with a young Brad Pitt pulling punches is a hard one to miss. The cult classic was adapted from the novel written in 1996 by Palahniuk, known for his mind-bending psychological thrillers. In this story, which is also the author&rsquo;s most-known work, an unnamed narrator suffers from serious insomnia and his life changes after meeting a stranger, Tyler Durden. They end up running Fight Club, which initially seem like a good way to let off steam but becomes something much more sinister. You would know better than to talk about Fight Club after reading the book.</p>
