        					<strong>6. Gifting of Digital Gift Cards</strong>
        					<br /><br />
        
        					6.1	When you purchase a Digital Gift Card for the purposes of gifting it to a recipient, the recipient will receive an email confirmation containing instructions to load the Digital Gift Card onto his/her App. We are not responsible for Digital Gift Cards that are undeliverable or not received due to your failure to enter an accurate email address for the recipient. If the recipient has not received the email confirmation within a reasonable period after the gifting has been initiated, the following is a list of the most common reasons why delivery may have failed:
        					<br /><br />
        
        					<ol class="alpha">
        						<li>spam filter blocked email or routed it to a bulk/spam folder;</li>
        						<li>recipient's firewall blocked the email;</li>
        						<li>email inbox has exceeded its size limit; or</li>
        						<li>invalid email address.</li>
        					</ol>
        
        					If a spam filter is blocking our emails from getting to the recipient’s inbox, the email options/settings of the recipient will need to be modified so that our emails are not considered spam.
        					<br /><br />
        
        					6.2	If the recipient has not yet received an email confirmation within 24 hours after you have initiated the purchase of the Digital Gift Card for the purposes of gifting it to a recipient, or if you need further assistance, please contact <a href="mailto:FRhelp@frasersproperty.com">FRhelp@frasersproperty.com</a>. Please refer to your Digital Gift Card number, or be ready to supply your email address.
