        <p>Running along Punggol reservoir and the Straits of Johor, this 6.1 km water-themed park connector links Punggol Promenade to Gerald Drive. Completed and opened to the public in 2010, it not only improves accessibility but also enhances biodiversity in the area, featuring a variety of birds including the majestic Grey Heron, migratory Little Egret and the commonly seen Collared Kingfisher.</p>
        <p>This park connector also joins Punggol Waterway and passes Anchorvale Community Club, Sengkang Sports Complex and Singapore&rsquo;s largest man-made wetland, Sengkang Floating Wetland, before ending at Gerald Drive.</p>
